Absolutely, Apurva. Let‚Äôs bring your SRO-53 ‚Üí SSRS-305 pair to full QA excellence using your Automation Test Engineer persona.

üü© System Requirement: SEGV-SRO-53

> ‚ÄúThe system shall provide a set of default hanging protocols.‚Äù



‚úÖ Objective:

Ensure the system provides fallback display logic (via default HPs) when no learned/user-defined HP is matched.


---

üü® Sub-System Requirement: SEGV-SSRS-305

> ‚ÄúThe system shall display a 1x1 viewport grid on the primary monitor containing the first series from the primary study when no other layout definition is present.‚Äù



‚úÖ Objective:

If no HP is matched, system falls back to showing the first series from the primary study in a 1x1 layout on the primary monitor.
