Series Selection Order	HP.mapping.seriesKey	e.g., by SeriesNumber or AcquisitionTime
Multi-Monitor Splits	HP.layout.splits	e.g., 2 viewports on each monitor


🔹 Test Scenarios for SSRS-288

✅ Positive

1. Verify that the grid definition from the HP (e.g., 2×2) is rendered correctly in the viewer.


2. Verify that each image display group is mapped to its designated viewport.


3. Verify that multi-monitor layouts split viewports across monitors as defined.


4. Verify that series selection for each display group uses the specified DICOM tag (SeriesNumber).


5. Verify that if two display groups map to the same viewport, the viewer throws a layout conflict warning.



❌ Negative

6. Verify that a malformed grid definition (e.g., “2×”) results in fallback to a safe default (1×1).


7. Verify that missing display-group entries leave the affected viewport blank but do not crash.


8. Verify that invalid monitor IDs in the HP cause all viewports to render on the primary monitor.



⚠️ Edge

9. Verify that extra display-group entries beyond grid capacity are ignored with a logged warning.


10. Verify that swapping monitor order (primary/secondary reversed) still honors the HP’s monitorIds.


11. Verify that the viewport mapping works when the same display group appears multiple times.


12. Verify that layout is reapplied correctly if the HP is switched mid-session.

🟨 SSRS-307

Requirement:

> “The front-end application shall wait for a response from the HP Service up to a configurable time threshold before applying a default hanging protocol.”



🔍 Breakdown of Timeout Logic

Aspect	Configuration	Notes

Timeout Threshold	config.hpServiceTimeoutMs	e.g., 3000 ms
Fallback Protocol	config.defaultHangingProtocol	ID of default HP to apply after TO
Response Handling	HPService API callback	success vs. failure vs. late
Logging	HPServiceTimeoutEvent	logs time, study UID, action


🔹 Test Scenarios for SSRS-307

✅ Positive

1. Verify that the system waits up to the configured timeout before applying any protocol.


2. Verify that if the HP Service responds in-time, its protocol is applied without fallback.


3. Verify that raising the timeout value delays fallback accordingly.



❌ Negative

4. Verify that if no response arrives within the timeout, the default hanging protocol is applied.


5. Verify that a failed or malformed response (HTTP 500 or invalid JSON) triggers fallback.


6. Verify that multiple sequential timeouts do not crash the viewer but always apply default HP.



⚠️ Edge

7. Verify that setting timeout=0 results in immediate fallback without waiting.


8. Verify that a response arriving just after timeout is ignored and does not override the fallback.


9. Verify that rapid toggling of this timeout config (e.g., via admin panel) is picked up on next launch.


10. Verify that a late valid response is logged but does not disrupt the already-applied default layout.

Let me know if you’d like these in Gherkin, a spreadsheet-style matrix, or as automation skeletons next!

-----------------------------76-----------------------
Below is the breakdown for SRO-76 (parent) and its SSRS-288 (rendering parameters) with every single minute detail covered as you requested.  Each scenario starts with “Verify…” and they’re clearly separated by SRO vs SSRS.


---

🟩 SRO-76

> “The system shall auto-apply a single hanging protocol when the viewer is launched for a given study.”



🔹 End-to-End Test Cases for SRO-76 (Rendering-focused)

1. Verify that on viewer launch the SRP engine is queried and returns a single HP including its rendering parameters.


2. Verify that the returned HP’s rendering parameters (viewType, WW/WL, RenderingMode, etc.) arrive in the client callback.


3. Verify that those rendering parameters are applied exactly to each viewport without user intervention.


4. Verify that if the HP service fails or times out, the default HP (with its own rendering params) is applied.


5. Verify that manual user changes to rendering after launch do not overwrite the auto-applied HP unless re-triggered.

Next Steps?

I can lay these out in a spreadsheet or Gherkin feature file.

Or we can jump to SSRS-307 or the next SRO you have. Let me know!

--------------------------307--------------------------

Below is the minute-detail breakdown for SSRS-307, with every test scenario starting with “Verify…”, organized by functional aspect, followed by Acceptance Criteria mapping.


---

🟨 SSRS-307

Requirement:

> “The system shall wait for a response from the HP Service up to a configurable time threshold before applying a default hanging protocol.”



Parent SRO: SRO-76
Impact: HP Client (GenesisViewer front-end)


---

🔍 Key Functional Aspects

Aspect	Description

Timeout Threshold	Configurable interval (ms or s) the client will wait for HP Service response
Service Response	Success payload (HP definition) or failure (error, malformed data, no response)
Fallback Protocol	Default hanging protocol applied after timeout or on service failure
Logging & Metrics	Client-side audit of wait duration, fallback event, and service response
Reactivity	How the viewer UI shows waiting state (spinner), then switches to default HP on timeout



---

✅ Detailed Test Scenarios

A. Configurable Timeout Behavior

1. Verify that the client reads the HP service timeout value from configuration on startup.


2. Verify that increasing the timeout value (e.g., from 3s to 10s) delays fallback proportionally.


3. Verify that setting timeout to zero results in immediate fallback without invoking service call.


4. Verify that invalid timeout values (negative, non-numeric) revert to a safe default (e.g., 3s).


5. Verify that changes to timeout in an admin panel take effect on the next viewer launch.



B. Successful Service Response Before Timeout

6. Verify that if the HP Service returns a valid HP definition within the timeout, that HP is applied.


7. Verify that the client stops the timeout countdown immediately on receiving a valid response.


8. Verify that no fallback HP is applied if a valid response arrives even 1ms before timeout.


9. Verify that the UI removes any loading spinner once a response is processed.



C. Service Failure or No Response (Timeout Fallback)

10. Verify that if the HP Service does not respond within the timeout, the default HP is applied automatically.


11. Verify that a request error (HTTP 500) triggers immediate fallback, ignoring remaining time.


12. Verify that a malformed or partially invalid response (invalid JSON) triggers fallback.


13. Verify that network disconnects or timeouts at the HTTP layer still result in fallback.


14. Verify that the fallback HP used matches the configured default (e.g., 1×1 grid).



D. Logging & Audit

15. Verify that the client logs the actual wait duration and timestamp when fallback occurs.


16. Verify that the log entry includes the reason (timeout vs. error vs. malformed response).


17. Verify that successful service responses are logged with response time metrics.


18. Verify that logs do not contain sensitive patient data—only protocol IDs and timestamps.



E. UI Feedback & User Experience

19. Verify that a visual loading indicator (spinner or status message) is shown while waiting.


20. Verify that the loading indicator disappears and default HP renders immediately after timeout.


21. Verify that switching away from the study before timeout cancels the wait and no fallback occurs.


22. Verify that multiple rapid launches (open/close) do not queue multiple timeouts or fallbacks.




---

⚠️ Edge Test Scenarios

23. Verify behavior when service responds precisely at the timeout boundary (race condition).


24. Verify that very large timeout values (e.g., 1 hour) do not block UI permanently.


25. Verify that mid-session HP re-applications also respect the timeout logic.


26. Verify that fallback logic works correctly in offline mode (no network).


27. Verify that partial responses (e.g., missing required HP fields) are treated as failures.


28. Verify that toggling timeout config at runtime (if supported) does not break current wait.
