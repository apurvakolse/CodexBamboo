Absolutely, Apurva. Let’s bring your SRO-53 → SSRS-305 pair to full QA excellence using your Automation Test Engineer persona.

🟩 System Requirement: SEGV-SRO-53

> “The system shall provide a set of default hanging protocols.”



✅ Objective:

Ensure the system provides fallback display logic (via default HPs) when no learned/user-defined HP is matched.

🟨 Sub-System Requirement: SEGV-SSRS-305

> “The system shall display a 1x1 viewport grid on the primary monitor containing the first series from the primary study when no other layout definition is present.”



✅ Objective:

If no HP is matched, system falls back to showing the first series from the primary study in a 1x1 layout on the primary monitor.

Monitor Mapping	HP.layout.monitorIds	Primary vs. secondary monitor targets
Display-Group → Viewport Mapping	HP.mapping.groups	e.g., “axial → viewport1”
Series Selection Order	HP.mapping.seriesKey	e.g., by SeriesNumber or AcquisitionTime
Multi-Monitor Splits	HP.layout.splits	e.g., 2 viewports on each monitor


🔹 Test Scenarios for SSRS-288

✅ Positive

1. Verify that the grid definition from the HP (e.g., 2×2) is rendered correctly in the viewer.


2. Verify that each image display group is mapped to its designated viewport.


3. Verify that multi-monitor layouts split viewports across monitors as defined.


4. Verify that series selection for each display group uses the specified DICOM tag (SeriesNumber).


5. Verify that if two display groups map to the same viewport, the viewer throws a layout conflict warning.



❌ Negative

6. Verify that a malformed grid definition (e.g., “2×”) results in fallback to a safe default (1×1).


7. Verify that missing display-group entries leave the affected viewport blank but do not crash.


8. Verify that invalid monitor IDs in the HP cause all viewports to render on the primary monitor.



⚠️ Edge

9. Verify that extra display-group entries beyond grid capacity are ignored with a logged warning.


10. Verify that swapping monitor order (primary/secondary reversed) still honors the HP’s monitorIds.


11. Verify that the viewport mapping works when the same display group appears multiple times.


12. Verify that layout is reapplied correctly if the HP is switched mid-session.

🟨 SSRS-307

Requirement:

> “The front-end application shall wait for a response from the HP Service up to a configurable time threshold before applying a default hanging protocol.”



🔍 Breakdown of Timeout Logic

Aspect	Configuration	Notes

Timeout Threshold	config.hpServiceTimeoutMs	e.g., 3000 ms
Fallback Protocol	config.defaultHangingProtocol	ID of default HP to apply after TO
Response Handling	HPService API callback	success vs. failure vs. late
Logging	HPServiceTimeoutEvent	logs time, study UID, action


🔹 Test Scenarios for SSRS-307

✅ Positive

1. Verify that the system waits up to the configured timeout before applying any protocol.


2. Verify that if the HP Service responds in-time, its protocol is applied without fallback.


3. Verify that raising the timeout value delays fallback accordingly.



❌ Negative

4. Verify that if no response arrives within the timeout, the default hanging protocol is applied.


5. Verify that a failed or malformed response (HTTP 500 or invalid JSON) triggers fallback.


6. Verify that multiple sequential timeouts do not crash the viewer but always apply default HP.



⚠️ Edge

7. Verify that setting timeout=0 results in immediate fallback without waiting.


8. Verify that a response arriving just after timeout is ignored and does not override the fallback.


9. Verify that rapid toggling of this timeout config (e.g., via admin panel) is picked up on next launch.


10. Verify that a late valid response is logged but does not disrupt the already-applied default layout.

Let me know if you’d like these in Gherkin, a spreadsheet-style matrix, or as automation skeletons next!

-----------------------------76-----------------------
Below is the breakdown for SRO-76 (parent) and its SSRS-288 (rendering parameters) with every single minute detail covered as you requested.  Each scenario starts with “Verify…” and they’re clearly separated by SRO vs SSRS.


---

🟩 SRO-76

> “The system shall auto-apply a single hanging protocol when the viewer is launched for a given study.”



🔹 End-to-End Test Cases for SRO-76 (Rendering-focused)

1. Verify that on viewer launch the SRP engine is queried and returns a single HP including its rendering parameters.


2. Verify that the returned HP’s rendering parameters (viewType, WW/WL, RenderingMode, etc.) arrive in the client callback.


3. Verify that those rendering parameters are applied exactly to each viewport without user intervention.


4. Verify that if the HP service fails or times out, the default HP (with its own rendering params) is applied.


5. Verify that manual user changes to rendering after launch do not overwrite the auto-applied HP unless re-triggered.

🟨 SSRS-288

> “The front-end application shall apply the display/rendering parameters as per the hanging protocol for each viewport.”



Rendering Parameters List (from your image):

viewType

WindowWidth

WindowLevel

RenderingMode

ThdRenderingMode

Rotate/Flip/Zoom (Supported only for Native viewType)



---

A. viewType

1. Verify that the viewType defined in the HP (e.g. “Axial–MIP”) is applied to the viewport on load.


2. Verify that all supported viewTypes (Native, Axial(Standard, MIP, MinIP, Average, VR), Sagittal, Coronal, 3D) render correctly.


3. Verify that an unknown viewType in the HP falls back to “Native” without error.


4. Verify that switching the HP mid-session updates each viewport’s viewType immediately.




---

B. WindowWidth & WindowLevel

5. Verify that WindowWidth and WindowLevel values from the HP are set on each viewport’s LUT.


6. Verify that invalid WW/WL values (e.g. negative, zero) in the HP revert to the viewer’s default WW/WL.


7. Verify that extreme WW/WL values (e.g. very narrow or very wide) are clamped to supported ranges.


8. Verify that modifying WW/WL manually after HP application does not persist across HP re-application.




---

C. RenderingMode

9. Verify that the RenderingMode parameter (e.g. “Standard”, “MIP”, “MinIP”, “VR”) is honored per viewport.


10. Verify that unsupported RenderingMode values in the HP default to “Standard” without crashing.


11. Verify that RenderingMode changes are synchronized if Sync is enabled (per SSRS-290).




---

D. ThdRenderingMode

12. Verify that the ThdRenderingMode (threshold rendering, e.g. bone-only) from the HP is applied if defined.


13. Verify that missing threshold settings fall back to the HP’s RenderingMode.


14. Verify that out-of-range threshold values (e.g. >255) are clamped or ignored gracefully.




---

E. Rotate / Flip / Zoom (Native Views Only)

15. Verify that Rotate, Flip, and Zoom operations defined in the HP are executed only when viewType=Native.


16. Verify that Rotate/Flip commands are ignored if viewType≠Native, with no console errors.


17. Verify that Zoom levels from the HP are applied exactly, and invalid zoom factors (e.g. negative) revert to 100%.


18. Verify that multiple sequential rotate/flip operations apply in the correct order (Rotate → Flip).

Next Steps?

I can lay these out in a spreadsheet or Gherkin feature file.

Or we can jump to SSRS-307 or the next SRO you have. Let me know!
