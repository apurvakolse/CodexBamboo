Absolutely, Apurva. Let‚Äôs bring your SRO-53 ‚Üí SSRS-305 pair to full QA excellence using your Automation Test Engineer persona.

üü© System Requirement: SEGV-SRO-53

> ‚ÄúThe system shall provide a set of default hanging protocols.‚Äù



‚úÖ Objective:

Ensure the system provides fallback display logic (via default HPs) when no learned/user-defined HP is matched.


---

üü® Sub-System Requirement: SEGV-SSRS-305

> ‚ÄúThe system shall display a 1x1 viewport grid on the primary monitor containing the first series from the primary study when no other layout definition is present.‚Äù



‚úÖ Objective:

If no HP is matched, system falls back to showing the first series from the primary study in a 1x1 layout on the primary monitor.

‚úÖ All Descriptive Test Scenarios for SRO-53 & SSRS-305

(Written using ‚ÄúVerify‚Ä¶‚Äù format, with Positive, Negative, and Edge scenarios‚Äîfully grounded in UI, backend, DICOM, and workflow behavior)


---

‚úÖ Positive Test Scenarios

1. Verify that the system applies the default 1x1 layout when no learned or user-defined hanging protocol is matched for a study


2. Verify that the first available series from the primary study is displayed in the 1x1 viewport when no layout is defined


3. Verify that the fallback 1x1 layout appears specifically on the primary monitor in single-monitor configurations


4. Verify that the system applies the fallback default layout consistently across modalities such as CT, MR, and US


5. Verify that the system applies the default layout even when the study contains multiple series without a matched HP


6. Verify that the default layout configuration is stored and retrieved correctly from system settings or configuration service


7. Verify that default HP is used when a new user with no preferences logs in and opens a study for the first time




---

‚ùå Negative Test Scenarios

8. Verify that the system displays a message or fallback content when the primary study contains no valid image series


9. Verify that the system does not crash when the default HP layout file is corrupted or malformed


10. Verify that an empty viewport is shown if the first series is not retrievable due to missing SOPInstanceUID or broken DICOM tags


11. Verify that the fallback layout still loads if the monitor configuration metadata is missing or incorrect


12. Verify that the viewer logs a warning or error if the default HP references a missing display group


13. Verify that no other protocols (manual, learned) override the fallback 1x1 layout once it's applied




---

‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Test Scenarios

14. Verify that when multiple series have the same Series Number, the viewer deterministically selects the first by acquisition time or SOPInstanceUID


15. Verify that in dual-monitor setups, the fallback 1x1 layout still renders on the primary monitor, not arbitrarily


16. Verify that the fallback 1x1 layout appears even when the study has partial metadata or non-standard compression (e.g., JPEG2000)


17. Verify that fallback 1x1 layout displays correctly on high-resolution or ultrawide monitors without stretching or misalignment


18. Verify that fallback applies instantly if the SRP engine times out or is disabled in configuration


19. Verify that fallback layout is not applied if a user-selected protocol exists even if SRP fails


20. Verify correct behavior when the system switches between online and offline mode (SRP service toggle)


21. Verify that the viewer reverts to fallback layout when the previously saved Learn Case was deleted before viewer launch
